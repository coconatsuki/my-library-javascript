# My Library javascript

This is a project from the online bootcamp 'The Odin Project' :

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library?ref=lnav

Here, I had to create a build a library app, using Javasscript and its "localStorage" system.

This project made me practice the use of pure Javascript (no jQuery) to create an app with basic functions:

- Add a new book (with a form that appear and disappear when we click the 'form button').

- Remove a book

- Toggle the 'have read' property, using a button

- Save the Library in the local Storage each time we add or remove a book.

- Load the local Storage on loading the app.

To practice some more, I used Bootstrap for the front end, as well as Sass.
